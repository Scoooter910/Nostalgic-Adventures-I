A mini game utilizing C# and kicking it back old school.
I wanted to create something that reminded me of how my passion developed.
As a young girl in the mid 80's, technology was far from advanced.
This game incorporates the "old school" feel. 
It is also a work in progress as I continue to develop my skills.
